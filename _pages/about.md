<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Fan Zhang with a doctoral degree in construction management and expertise in the ***health and safety resilience of urban buildings against disasters*** and ***innovative technologies for built environment***. Currently, I am working at the Department of Building and Real Estate at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a ***research assistant professor***. The Department of Building and Real Estate at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University excels in the field of the civil engineering and the built environment, as evidenced by its 17th ranking in the QS World University Rankings 2025 by subject Engineering – Civil and Structural and Architecture/ Built Environment. 

My research interest includes **Urban disaster resilience; Urban safety and health; Cascading effects; Building evacuation; Sustainable built environment; Large Language Model; Geo-Knowledge graph; Digital and intelligent techniques; and relevant disciplinary research**, aiming to significantly contribute to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of **“Sustainable cities and communities: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”** and **“Climate action: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”**. I have published more than 40 papers at the academic journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
